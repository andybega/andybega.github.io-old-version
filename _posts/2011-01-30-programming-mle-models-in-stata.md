Another set of notes from when I was TA for our Advanced Quantitative Methods course with Prof. Matt Golder in 2008. The notes for [Programming MLE models in Stata]({{ site.url }}/content/2011/StataMLEprogram.pdf) (pdf) walk you through how to recreate your own logit regression command and ado files for Stata, as well as how to use simulations to check your model.  [Here]({{ site.url }}/content/2011/StataMLEprogram.zip) are also the associated ado and do files.

The notes are closely based on *Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Stata* (2006, see full citation in the notes), which is definitely worth it if you are considering writing your own MLE commands in Stata.
