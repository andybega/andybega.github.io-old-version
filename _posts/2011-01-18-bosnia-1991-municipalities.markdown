[![Bosnia with 1995 municipalities]({{ site.url }}/assets/2011/yugoslavia.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/assets/2011/yugoslavia.jpg)

This dates back to work I did in 2008, but some people seem to find it useful:

At the beginning of the Yugoslav civil wars, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) consisted of 109 municipalities. Finding free geographic layers with those municipal boundaries was difficult so I recreated them from National Geophysical Data Center Coastline Extractor, using World Data Bank II. Municipality names and demographic information come from the 1991 Yugoslav census courtesy wikipedia.  [This zipped folder]({{ site.url }}/assets/2011/bih_adminboundaries.zip) contains both the ArcMap shapefiles as well as a copy of the working paper that describes in further detail how the boundary shapefiles were created, data sources, etc.
