<p>I've been working with SIGACT data (military significant activities reports) all day as part of a research project. When you are dealing with thousands of them, it is easy to trivialize and forget the amount of human suffering encapsulated in each event (and those we don't hear about). </p>
<p>Yesterday, in Afghanistan, 2nd Lieutenant Justin Sisson was among the dead in a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/03/afghanistan-suicide-bombing_n_3377090.html">suicide bombing</a> that killed another NATO soldier and 9 children. We went to ROTC and Iraq together, and he was an impressive and amazing person. It is sad and unexpected that his life was cut short.</p>
<p>Maybe a few years from now researchers will have access to the SIGACT report associated with his death. I hope that something comes out of it that will prevent horrible things like this from happening.</p>
