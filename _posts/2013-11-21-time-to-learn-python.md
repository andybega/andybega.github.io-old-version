Apparently Python is taking over the world ([from a post](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2013/11/18/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/) by [Tal Yarkoni](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/about/)):

> In 2013, my toolbox looks like this:
> 
> *   Python for text processing and miscellaneous scripting;
> *   Ruby on Rails/JavaScript for web development, except for an occasional date with Django or Flask (Python frameworks);
> *   Python (NumPy/SciPy) for numerical computing;
> *   Python (Neurosynth, NiPy etc.) for neuroimaging data analysis;
> *   Python (NumPy/SciPy/pandas/statsmodels) for statistical analysis;
> *   Python (MatPlotLib) for plotting and visualization, except for web-based visualizations (JavaScript/d3.js);
> *   Python (scikit-learn) for machine learning;
> *   Excursions into other languages have dropped markedly.

I can't speak on the relative merits of Python over R, other than a general impression that R has [stronger stats](http://www.r-bloggers.com/r-vs-python-practical-data-analysis-nonlinear-regression/) but some [quirks as a language (pdf)](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf), while Python is generally [more powerful](http://www.r-bloggers.com/life-is-short-use-python/), but less capable beyond basic statistical tools. I did spend some time trying to learn Python during my last year in graduate school, but it was while I was really still becoming comfortable with R and so I didn't put much effort into it. Seems like it's time to head back in that direction again.
