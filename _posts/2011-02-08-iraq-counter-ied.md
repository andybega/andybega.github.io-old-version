A long time ago, in a place far away, I wrote [this (pdf)]({{ site.url }}/assets/2011/Iraq%20III.pdf). Random thoughts on counter-IED in northern Iraq, and gripes about living there.

Not knowing, I was on my way to death from cancer at the time. Maybe that's why I wasn't positive.

In retrospect I have to also admit even more how much more difficult the combat arms soldiers and officers have it. My life was plush in comparison.
