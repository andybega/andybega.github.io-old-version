## Other papers

1. [Precision-recall curves](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2765419)
<br> 2016, *on SSRN* ([pdf]({{ site.url }}/content/papers/Beger_2016_PrecisionRecallCurves.pdf))
<br> For rare outcomes (\**cough*\*, a lot of IR), ROC curves and the area under them are not a great measure of model fit. Look at (the area under) precision-recall curves as well. 

1. **Using front lines to predict deaths in the Bosnian civil war**
<br> 2012, ([pdf]({{ site.url }}/content/papers/Beger_2012_Bosnia.pdf))
<br> To be useful for forecasting and prediction, a statistical model needs to be feasible given the data it requires. This paper examines the relationship between front lines and other, time-invariant variables, and killings during the Bosnian civil war from 1992 to 1995. It uses a Bayesian spatial count model to estimate and compare model fit to other, more established conflict models. One of the dissertation papers.

2. [Explaining and predicting interstate war deaths](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2765421)
<br> 2012, *on SSRN* ([pdf]({{ site.url}}/content/papers/Beger_2012_WarFatalities.pdf))
<br> This paper is about predicting interstate war battle deaths. Data on 89 interstate wars between 1815 and 1991 is used to estimate a truncated regression model that provides the basis for out-of sample forecasts for two other wars. Also a dissertation paper. 

3. **Predicting the intensity and location of violence in war**
<br> 2012, ([pdf]({{ site.url }}/content/papers/Beger_A_2012_Dissertation.pdf))
<br> My three-papers-wrapped-together Ph.D. dissertation. 

4. **Simulating the Effects of Selection Bias in the Minorities at Risk Project.**
<br> 2008, ([pdf]({{ site.url }}/content/papers/Beger_2008_MARSelectionBias.pdf))
<br> How much of a problem is it that the Minority at Risk project collects information only for ethnic groups that are "at risk", i.e. selection on the dependent variable?
