I am a data scientist at [Ward Associates](http://www.wardassociatesinc.com), a consulting firm, where I work on predictive modeling of political conflict. 

My previous position was as Postdoctoral Fellow at Duke University in the [Wardlab group](http://www.mdwardlab.com), where I contributed to the forecasting component of the W-ICEWS global forecasting project, developed and maintained near-real time forecasts of irregular leadership change--coups, mass protests, and armed rebellion--for the Political Instability Task Force (PITF), and did predictive modeling of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and similar mines in Afghanistan and Colombia. 

I was a reservist in the US military for 13 years, and finished my career as a military intelligence officer. In that capacity I have overseen real-world tracking and prediction of IED and other violent activities during a deployment to northern Iraq. 

In between these projects I have experience with R for general data management and analysis, MySQL for maintaining a 230 million plus event database, and PostGIS/Postgresql for managing and processing spatial data. 

I was born and raised in Germany and Croatia, and lived in the US for 15 years. Since 2014 I live in Tallinn, Estonia.
