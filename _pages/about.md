I'm a political scientists by training, and I work as a data scientist on modeling and predicting political conflict, mostly using R and MySQL/PostgreSQl/PostGIS. Here are some things about me that might be interesting:

* I enjoy helping people with data wrangling and statistical programming issues. It's a large part of what I did as a graduate methods teaching assistant for a few semesters. 
* I was a reservist in the US military for 13 years, and spent 7 months in northern Iraq in a job related to prediction. 
* I had and survived leukemia not so long ago, as a young adult. 
* My mother languages are German and Serbian, I speak English mostly now, and am learning Estonian. I've lived in Germany and the US for most of my life, but spent all of my childhood summers on the beautiful Croatian coast. 
* I live in Tallinn, Estonia, with my wife and daughter and our dog.
