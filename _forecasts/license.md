I make no guarantees whatsoever that these forecasts are accurate, useful, or anything else. Use them for whatever you like, but don't hold me responsible for anything that does or does not happen as a result. The only thing I ask, if you use these forecasts or write about them, is to give me credit and if possible point back to this website descripting the forecasts.
